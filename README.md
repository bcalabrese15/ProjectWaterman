So today, I'm going to mainly be brainstorming my next project, which will combine programming with another hobby of mine, cartography. The plan is to create a program that takes a map as an input and outputs a coastline map.

For example, something like this: https://www.alternatehistory.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&media=resources:blank_map_2015.png

I doubt I'll be programming today, but we'll see how the day progresses.

Expectations:			
-preferably in Java, although I do want to learn more python so that wouldn't be too terrible
-going to involve a lot of pixel-mapping-type programming, similar to the painbucket in most computer drawing tools
-I would like it to fill in continents and oceans with different colors, but we'll see how difficult that is
-probably going to look for color differences in the map
