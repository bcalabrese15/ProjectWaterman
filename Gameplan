Here's the gameplan so far:

-Take an image
-Find each black pixel that borders a blue pixel (water)
-Take those and put them on a new image
-Done

Possible problems:

-Names that are written in black will be counted
-Countries that are colored blue will have their land borders included(probably won't happen if the map isn't garbage)
-Maps that don't have the water colored blue(older maps)
-I believe I need to create a fixed size new image, so any maps that are not that size will have to be scaled somehow

Will start actually writing code today, but probably not much
